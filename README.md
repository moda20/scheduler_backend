# Scheduler Backend

This is the repo for the Scheduler backend. This acts as a task manager and authentication server.

## 📦 Installation

The installation process is best done via a docker container, here is a compose example

```yaml
  scheduler_backend:
    image: ghcr.io/moda20/scheduler_backend:latest
    container_name: scheduler_backend
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./:/usr/src/app/src/jobs:ro
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/src/logs/
      - ./outputs:/usr/src/app/src/outputs/
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

the compose file above will expose port 8080 and can take 3 volumes:

- the jobs directory, should map to your project root directory, if you are using extra packages this shoudl point
  to where your `package.json` is located
- The logs directory, will be split into sub directories for general logs and job specific logs (if enabled)
- The outputs directory, will save output files from jobs if exporting functions are used

## 🛠 Usage

To see the best way to using this scheduler backend is with the interface created for it (see starter example)

The backend exports an API that will be detailed using swagger (enabled by default) on the route `/api-docs`.

## Development

The Scheduler_backend is built using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for the runtime and [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) for the server/API framework.
The following are the most pertinent packages used in tandem with the above : 

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the ORM and migrations
- [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for logging
- [Scheduler Manager](https://github.com/moda20/node-schedule-manager) for the CRON based scheduling

### Running backend locally
To run the backend app locally :
- Have bun installed : installation instructions [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- Clone the repo : `git clone https://github.com/moda20/scheduler_backend.git`
- Install the dependencies : `bun install`
- Run the app : `bun dev`
- to build the app run : `bun build`

A .env file is necessary for the app to run, the .env.example file is provided as a template and check the table above
